    2. standardized test scores (e.g., GRE, TOEFL/IELTS for international students), 
    3. recommendation letters, 
    4. a statement of purpose, 
  
  and sometimes a resume or CV. Each program may have specific requirements, so it's important to carefully review them. 

- `Researching Programs:` It is essential to find programs that align with personal and academic goals.
- `Funding Opportunities:` Teaching or Research assistantships, fellowships, or scholarships.

### Research opportunities

- **Where to get involved in research**
.small[
- `Work hard for class projects:` They are great showcases for what you have done.
- `Talk to your professors:` They are often the best resources for finding research opportunities.

- `Read emails:` Keep an eye on department emails or newsletters for announcements about research opportunities, internships, or assistantships. 
]

- **Additional Tips for Finding Research Opportunities**
.small[
- `Attend Research Seminars:` Many campuses host research seminars where professors and students present their work. Attending these can help you learn about research areas of interest and make connections.
- `Participate in the Statistical Consulting Center:` Many universities with a Statistics department offer a Statistical Consulting Center where students can assist faculty, staff, and external clients with real-world data analysis problems. It's a great way to apply what you've learned and gain practical experience.
